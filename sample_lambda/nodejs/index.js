   An interface describes a fuctionality or a health measurement supported by the skills kit.
   Alexa health supports four interfaces as of now: Weight, Sleep, DiaperChange, InfantFeeding.

   A directive describes an operation that can be performed against an interface. Alexa Health supports
   following directives: add, get, start, stop, pause, cancel, switch. Out of these 7 directives
    1. add,get directives can be performed against all four interfaces.
    2. start, stop, pause, cancel can be perfomed only against Sleep and InfantFeeding interfaces.
    3. switch can be performed only against InfantFeeding interface.

    See: https://developer.amazon.com/docs/health/overview.html#interfaces to learn
    about interfaces and directives.
